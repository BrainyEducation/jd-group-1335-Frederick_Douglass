# Project HearATale Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglas
Project HearATale aims to create a web based application designed to help below average literacy level high school students improve in their reading comprehension.
Our team aims to create a web based e-reader through javascript, html, and react that allows the user to read the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglas while supported by
an audio reader. To improve on user literacy and comprehension our final deliverable aims to provide user word pronounciation, word definitions, and word quizzes.
