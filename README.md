# Project HearATale Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglas

## Text parser (`main.py`)
To use the text parser, we rely on `pipenv` to make sure all our dependencies are installed.
To use this project:
1. Make sure that all the necessary files are in the correct place. The text (in our case the Frederick Douglass .txt file) should be stored as `text.txt` under `./assets/text_to_parse` and the already-recorded words should be stored under that same directory as `recorded_words.txt` (this step is already done for you unless you want to parse some different text).
2. Install `python3`.
3. Install `pip`.
4. On the command line, run `pip install`.
5. On the command line, run `python3 main.py` to parse the text.
6. The output will be produced under `./assets/out`.
